Your goal is to successfully build and run the workspace as local development environment. Track your progress using #tool:todo .

Start by snalyzing required dependencies from package.json and README.md to install them.

Then validate that all key development build tasks and CLI commands are functional.

If everything was set up already, give the user a quick tour of the workspace.
